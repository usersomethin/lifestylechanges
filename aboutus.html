        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>This is the official website of Team 11 from SVKM J.V. Parekh International School.
            We are a commited group of Grade 10 students engaged in our IGCSE Global Perspectives
            Team Project. We worked together as a team utilizing our specifically chosen skills to help with this project.
            This website represents the result of months of research, discussion and teamwork focusing 
            on a global issue that we  believe is critical to our world today. </p>

        <h1>Why This Topic?</h1>
        <p>We chose this topic because while surfing the internet one of our team members found out that 
            there are a lot of beliefs that have been followed from generations and are being passed on to 
            the future. After that, we got the opportunity to find out more about it by the help of this 
            project. We all have had some beliefs and superstitions that have been passed on to us but 
            some of us didn't even know what they meant. So, we wanted to find out more about it and 
            share our findings with the world. We also wanted to know how these beliefs have changed 
            over time and how they have been adapted to modern lifestyles. We believe that understanding 
            these changes can help us appreciate the importance of preserving cultural heritage while 
            embracing modern advancements.
        </p>
